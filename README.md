# CinemaE-Booking-project
Fall 2021 Project

Hello, this is a spring boot application project from my Fall 2021 semseter! 
During this project I was mostly responsible for front end development however closer to the end of term I became responsible for back end development on the shopping cart, booking movies, using promotions, and checking out! I have also added images of these processes when ran in springboot under CinemaE-Booking-project/bookingimgs

Below are portions I specifically worked on!

Seat.java
SeatList.java
SeatListRepository.java
Promotion.java
PromotionRepository.java
AppController.java (booking seats and Promotion, might be hard to pinpoint in code)
MovieShowingRepository.java
